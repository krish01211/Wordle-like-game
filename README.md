# Wordle Clone (Symbol Edition)

A fun twist on the classic **Wordle** game!  
Instead of colored tiles, our project uses **different symbols** to indicate correctness.  

---

## 🎮 How To Play
- Guess the **5-letter word** in **6 tries**.  
- Each guess must be a **valid word**.  
- After each guess, symbols will show how close your guess was:  

### Symbols:
- ✅ = Letter is in the word **and in the correct spot**  
- ❓ = Letter is in the word but **in the wrong spot**  
- ❌ = Letter is **not in the word**
